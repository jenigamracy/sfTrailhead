# sfTrailhead

This repository contains the majority of the work I had to do when
working through the modules on the Salesforce Trailhead.

This is for reference only, just so I have something to refer to in case I 
need to re-do any module work in the future.

/modules contains the work done in modules as well as their challenges, if applicable. 

/playgrounds contains the work in the modules as well as the challenges.
The files do not apply to a particular module, but serves as a backup if
I want examples in the future.

This does not include work completed for superbadges.
