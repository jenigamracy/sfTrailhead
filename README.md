# sfTrailhead

This repository contains the majority of the work I had to do when
working through the modules on the Salesforce Trailhead.

This is for reference only, just so I have something to refer to in case I 
need to re-do any module-work in the future.

# playgrounds/
This folder contains the work in the modules as well as their challenges.
The files apply more to a trail than a module, though I've had to create
new playgrounds at some point through trails to avoid issues between modules.
